Time to formulate your Learning Plan! Write your findings on a temporary document (word, google docs, text edit etc). The Learning Plan needs to include the following elements:

A description of your own strengths and limitations
    Leadership - "Leadership is not about titles, positions or flowcharts. It is about on life influencing another" - John Maxwell
    Good Communicator - I love to talk to people and relate to everyone in some way or another.
    Accountability - I will be accountable for myself, my actions and my time.

Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    I will make a commitment to reach out and ask for help if and whenever I may need it. I will also help anyone that I can.

A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
    I expect nothing from the facilitation team. I believe one of the keys to happiness lies within management of your expectations of people and circumstances.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.
    I have no regular scheduling commitments.

These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
