<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

<h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
   <p>Understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity could benefit people in so much ways. Knowing that you can achieve any task by simply imagining the outcome first will give people so much more belief in themselves.</p>

<h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
    <p>I can think of one instance in which Neuroplasticity has helped me without even realising. I have grown up playing Softball and everynight before my game, I would lie there and imagine how I would hit the ball, or how I would make the game winning catch. Come game time and I would perform because I had gone through the process in my head 100 times over.</p>

<h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>One way to increase your neuroplasticity is to imagine what you want to do before you do it. Your imagination and your actions both engage the same neural pathways and using one will usually influencen the other.</p>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
   <p> Having a Growth Mindset is knowing your abilities can be developed through good teaching, effort and persistance for when the going gets tough.</p>
   <p> A Fixed Mindset is when your abilities are ingrained or fixed to a certain level and you have no thought of changing your mind. </p>
   <p> A common story that can explain the difference between a Growth and Fixed Mindset is The Tortoise and the Hare. The Hare gets off to a good start and decides to take a rest because he thinks he will win with ease and does not need to worry. Old mate Tortoise takes his time and knows that as long as he keeps moving, he will make it to the end. The Hares mindset is so fixed that he does not pay attention while the Tortoise creeps past to win the race.</p>
    

<h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
   <p>I learnt more around applying the growth mndset and how fixed my mindset was in the past.</p>

<h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>I think something as great as a growth mindset will fit into my learning journey quite easily.</p>

<h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
