    <h3> An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h3>
      <p>If I was to explain the difference between HTML and CSS, it would be like the difference between a Builder(HTML) and a Painter(CSS). When building a house,you need HTML to build the it and it will not be completed without the help of CSS.</p>
      
      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life. </h3>
       <p>Control flow is basically the order you follow when you go about your daily tasks. For example, you have a big game on tonight and you must prepare. You start off with opening your bag and laying out your gears. Your ankle sprain is still giving you grief so you have to strap it up first. The desired outcome is to put on your shoes. Now you cant put on your shoe until you strap your foot and put on your socks. This is the control flow used to get prepared and the loop is that you put on your shoe until the prior steps are done.</p>   
       
      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface to webpages. It is designed to be used with any programming language. It it accessed through the developer tools option on Google Chrome. It allows you to manipluate the information on a webpage without having any understanding of coding.</p>
      
      <h3>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>An Array is a special variable that can hold multiple values at one time. An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
        Objects are variables too that contain many values. </p>

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
        <p>A function is basically a block of code that is designed to perform a certain task. It is executed when it is called upon.</p>
