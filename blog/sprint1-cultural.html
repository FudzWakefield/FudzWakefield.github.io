            <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
            <p>My culture is definitely in alignment with my values. I was raised in a big whanau and although we didnt have the material things in life, we always had eachother. That love is still there to this day. We were also raised to respect our elders. That same level of respect has been carried through my life and I respect everyone for who they are.</p>
             
            <h2>What are your strengths and limitations.</h2>
            <p>My Strengths are Leadership, Communicating and Accountability.</p>
            
            <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
            <p>I love leadership because it has always been a role that I find myself in. I love creating a sense of culture and belonging in everyting I do and uniting people at the same time is an added bonus.</p>
            <p>I Also love communicating and getting to know people on a personal level. I am equally a good listener and I find this helps when trying to understand a korero from another persons point of view.</p>
            <p>Accountabilty is essential. If I say I am going to do something, I hold myself accountable until the task is complete. This sense of Accountability helps me especially when I have specific goal with a deadline. I will manage my time more efficiently knowing I cannot let myself down.</p>
            
            <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
            <p>I generally work well with others. If I am in a new work environment, I shut up, do my job and show respect to the people in charge. If I am in charge, seek to gain an understanding from the people around me so that we are constantly on the same page. I am a great leader and a great follower.</p>
            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
            <p> I live my life through my values and find that most situations are solved with them. For example if someone was stealing, I would do the right thing naturally.</p>
