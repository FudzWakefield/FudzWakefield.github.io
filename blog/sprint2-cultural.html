        <h1>Fudz Wakefield Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations </h2>
                <p> Leadership - "Leadership is not about titles, positions or flowcharts. It is about on life influencing another" - John Maxwell </p>
                <p> Good Communicator - I love to talk to people and relate to everyone in some way or another.</p>
                <p> Accountability - I will be accountable for myself, my actions and my time.</p>
            
        <h2> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
            
                <p> I am committed to reaching out and asking for help if and whenever I may need it. </p>
                <p> I am committed to helping my team and working together in order to reach our end goal.</p>
                <p> I will always keep in contact with my facilitators, regardlessn of my circumstances.</p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team </h2>
                <p> I expect nothing from the facilitation team. I believe one of the keys to happiness lies within management of your expectations of people and circumstances.</p>
            
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
            For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h2>
                <p> I have a couple of one off events such as a Leadership Conference in Melbourne (19th to 25th of Feb), My Brothers Wedding (March 8th to 10th)</p>
